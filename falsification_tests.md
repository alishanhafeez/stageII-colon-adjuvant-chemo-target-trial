Falsification and Stress Tests

To assess the plausibility of the identifying assumptions and detect residual bias, we prespecified a series of falsification and stress tests. These analyses are not intended to estimate clinically meaningful effects, but rather to evaluate whether the analytic design produces spurious associations when none should exist.

Negative Control Outcomes.
We will estimate the association between adjuvant chemotherapy initiation and non–cancer-related mortality outcomes that should not be causally affected by chemotherapy, including death due to accidental injury and death due to non-malignant respiratory disease. Under valid identification and adequate confounding control, the estimated effects for these outcomes should be null. Substantial deviations from the null would suggest residual confounding or selection bias.

Negative Control Exposure.
As a negative control exposure, we will assign a pseudo-treatment corresponding to chemotherapy initiation occurring after the end of the 8-week treatment assignment window. Because this exposure occurs after the treatment decision period, it should have no causal effect on colon cancer–specific mortality. Detection of an apparent effect would indicate residual immortal time bias or misalignment of time zero.

Temporal Falsification Test.
We will examine mortality occurring within the first 30 days following surgery. Because adjuvant chemotherapy initiation occurs after surgery, no protective effect should be observed during this early period. Evidence of an apparent benefit in early postoperative mortality would suggest bias arising from inappropriate temporal ordering or unmeasured baseline health differences.

Stress Test for Positivity and Model Dependence.
We will inspect the distribution of stabilized inverse probability weights and assess sensitivity to alternative truncation thresholds. Marked instability or sensitivity of effect estimates to truncation would indicate limited overlap in treatment assignment and reduced reliability of causal estimates.

Interpretation.
Consistent null findings in negative control analyses and stability across stress tests will increase confidence that the primary effect estimates are not driven by residual confounding or time-related bias. Failure of these falsification tests will prompt reassessment of the identification strategy and analytic design prior to interpretation of primary results.
