The estimand of interest is the intention-to-treat effect of initiating adjuvant fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy versus observation on 5-year colon cancer–specific mortality among patients with high-risk stage II colon cancer. Time zero is defined as the date of curative surgical resection, the earliest point at which eligibility and treatment decisions are determined, thereby eliminating immortal time bias that would arise if follow-up were initiated at chemotherapy receipt. Identification relies on the assumption that, conditional on measured baseline covariates, treatment assignment is independent of potential outcomes. Adjustment for baseline demographic, socioeconomic, and tumor characteristics blocks all backdoor paths between adjuvant chemotherapy initiation and mortality, as encoded in the prespecified causal DAG. Postoperative complications and chemotherapy completion are not adjusted for because they occur after treatment assignment and lie on the causal pathway; conditioning on these variables would induce bias through collider stratification or overadjustment. Under these assumptions, stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting constructs a pseudo-population in which baseline confounders are balanced across treatment strategies, emulating randomization at surgery. In this weighted population, differences in colon cancer–specific mortality can be attributed to the treatment strategies rather than baseline differences. The primary remaining threat to identification is residual confounding by unmeasured functional status or frailty not fully captured in registry and claims data, which is addressed through sensitivity analyses.
