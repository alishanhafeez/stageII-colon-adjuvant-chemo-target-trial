Analysis Plan

Primary Analysis.
The primary analysis will estimate the intention-to-treat effect of adjuvant chemotherapy initiation versus observation on colon cancer–specific mortality. Stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights will be applied to construct a pseudo-population in which baseline covariates are balanced across treatment strategies. Weighted cumulative incidence functions and weighted hazard estimates will be used to compare outcomes between strategies over 5 years of follow-up. Effect estimates will be reported as risk differences and hazard ratios with corresponding confidence intervals.

Propensity Score Estimation.
The propensity score for initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy within 8 weeks of surgery will be estimated using logistic regression including all prespecified baseline covariates. No post-baseline variables will be included. Model specification will be fixed prior to outcome analysis.

Weight Diagnostics.
Stabilized weights will be summarized using descriptive statistics and visual inspection. Extreme weights will be truncated at prespecified percentiles to preserve positivity. Covariate balance will be assessed using standardized mean differences, with values below 0.1 indicating acceptable balance.

Outcome Modeling.
Weighted time-to-event analyses will be conducted with surgery date as time zero. Colon cancer–specific mortality will be treated as the primary endpoint, with administrative censoring at 5 years. Overall survival will be analyzed as a secondary outcome.

Sensitivity Analyses.
Sensitivity analyses will include alternative definitions of the treatment initiation window, restriction to subsets with unambiguous high-risk features, and comparison of weighted and unweighted estimates to assess model dependence.

Reporting.
All analyses will follow the prespecified plan. Deviations, if any, will be explicitly documented and justified. Results will be interpreted in light of the stated causal assumptions and falsification tests.
